In this Game You Are A Key, You must avoid the coins that move in horrizontal lines and move to the back of the map, the game has a bug where if you die you go through the ground so you only have one shot! or just reset the tab.

Controls are simple, You can use WASD or The Arrow Keys. A to move left, S to go down, W to go forward, D to go right. You won't need anything else! Enjoy!
